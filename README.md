# PDesire's GSI patches for pdx206

Magisk module to add some specific patches (and soon apps) to improve GSI usage on Xperia 5 II devices
## Requirements
- Magisk (v24+)
- Xperia 5 II 
- Running GSI with Android version 12.1

## Features
- Add correct power_profile.xml for better power profiling of the system
- Add Ambient Display 
- Add some props from Sony Custom ROMs
- also fixes some layouting

### Tested on
- Pixel Experience (Plus) GSI
- CherishOS GSI
- crDroid GSI

**DISCLAIMER**: The overlays will probably work on Xperia 1 II too, but it's not tested. You are warned!

## Patched overlay sources
The sources can be found here: https://github.com/PDesire/pdx206-pdesire-gsi-patch-overlays

This repo will only contain the already by me precompiled overlay apks.
